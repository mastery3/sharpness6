For Fabric

Minecraft caps your gear's potential, preventing you from making that totally not overpowered Sharpness X sword.

This mod fixes that, so you can waste all of your experience on that sword. Oh, and so you actually have something to do in the deep late-game.

Note that this mod does not do anything by default; you'll have to edit the configuration for any changes to take effect.
