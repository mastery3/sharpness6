For Fabric

Minecraft caps your gear's potential, preventing you from making that totally not overpowered Sharpness X sword.

This mod fixes that, so you can waste all of your experience on that sword. Oh, and so you actually have something to do in the deep late-game.

A: Yep. The mod is pretty easy to port, so... (except for 1.20.6, in which case I had to rewrite the entire thing)

Q: Can I use this in a modpack?
A: Sure.
