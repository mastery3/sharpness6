For Fabric

Minecraft caps your gear's potential, preventing you from making that totally not overpowered Sharpness X sword.

This mod fixes that, so you can waste all of your experience on that sword. Oh, and so you actually have something to do in the deep late-game.

NOTE: This mod is only hosted on Modrinth and Github. Any other distributions of this mod are untrustworthy, even if the website itself is not malicious. stopmodreposts.com attempts to prevent this.

FAQ

Q: Will you port this to future versions?
A: Yep. The mod is pretty easy to port, so... (except for 1.20.6, in which case I had to rewrite the entire thing)

Q: Can I use this in a modpack?
A: Sure.
